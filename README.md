# Performance-aware programming in Rust

## Intro 
This is the repo I use to save my dabblings with [C.M.'s course](https://www.computerenhance.com/).
It is my first attempt at learning in public.
I will document my learning here to keep as a reference and look back at the path I have treaded.

## Dependencies
For testing purposes only, you will need :
  - the [Netwide Assembler : nasm](https://www.nasm.us/)

## TODO
I am currently writing a dissassembler for the Intel's 8086 architecture.
The following tasks need to be done :
  - adding listings provided in the course as test cases

## What I learnt
  - Ontop of cache friendliness, instruction level paralellism is a parameter for speed
